# Nomad Helper Scripts


These are just some bash scripts that I use to make my reproduction life at work slightly less bad.  They are based on my lab cluster, so your mileage may vary.


 * [nomad_gc](nomad_gc) -
 * [nomad_push](nomad_push) - This script enables me to push in Nomad versions into the /opt/nomad/bin folders on all of the lab machines.
 * [nomad_reset](nomad_reset) - 
 * [nomad_start])nomad_start) - 
 * [nomad_stop_all](nomad_stop_all) - 
 * [nomad_version](nomad_version) - 


 * [cluster_push](cluster_push) - 
 * [consul_push](consul_push) - This script enables me to push in Consul versions into the /opt/consul/bin folders on all of the lab machines.
